# TokenBurn Smart Contract

## Vision

The **TokenBurn** smart contract provides a mechanism to permanently remove tokens from circulation by sending them to a designated burn address. This contract is designed to reduce token supply, which can be used for deflationary tokenomics or to enhance scarcity in a decentralized system.

## Features

- **Token Burning**:
  - Users can burn tokens by transferring them to a designated "burn" address, removing them from circulation permanently.
- **Balance Checking**:
  - Users can check the remaining token balance of any account after burning tokens.

## Future Scope

1. **Burn Event Logging**:

   - Add logging functionality to track and record token burn events for auditing and transparency.

2. **Burn Rate Governance**:

   - Implement governance features that allow the community to vote on token burn rates or thresholds.

3. **Multi-Token Support**:
   - Expand the system to support the burning of various token types across different projects.

The **TokenBurn** contract offers a simple and efficient way to reduce token supply, enhancing the utility and value of deflationary economic models on the blockchain.
